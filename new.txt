1. MDM Solution design for "Neupogen"
1.1 Solution Overview

Automated/Semi-automated extraction of the relevant product data for the authoritative source's Store data in structure business friendly format to be verified by business partners /SMEs (Excel).

Current scope of the system is to load the product data provided by business SME in Excel files extracted from SMPC documents

Process will be written to convert unstructured file provided by business SME with standard template called as ingestion template.

Ingestion template source file(Product data) will be loaded into MDM base objects through IDQ pipeline.

ETL pipeline will cleanse, standerdlize and transform raw data and will load into MDM base objects as per the product's subject area.


Ul will allow users to search, add, and modify the product information as per their role and permission.

Product Master data from the Base objects will publish to CDL layer.

Downstreem system can consume data from CDL layer


1.2 Source File

The product details are provided by the Business SME team in CSV/Excel format. Each file comprises product information distributed across 43 folders, with one folder allocated for each product. Within each product folder, data is organized into six classes (Medicinal Product), further categorized into six different subfolders. The source file lacks structure and necessitates formatting for ingestion via ETL processes.

Sample file attached.

1.3 Ingestion Template

The source file provided by the SME requires conversion into a standard template to facilitate ETL ingestion through a custom program.

1.3.1 Python Script

This script consolidates all source files (one for each class and product), preserving the parent-child table relationship using entity index, parent entity index, and child entity index.

1.4 ETL Pipeline Design:

The output file generated by the Python script must be placed in the following S3 location. The IDQ ETL mapping will utilize these locations as the data source.

S3 Path:

amgen-eea-emdmpm > dev > Inbound > work_dir > PMDM_INGESTION_TEMPLATE.csv

1.4.1 Mapping Details:

The table below outlines the mapping names and their purposes for each IDQ ETL mapping.

Tables used to generate dynamic SQL Script in mapping (m_pm_stg_ing_rtn):

1. C_L_REPOS_SQL: Repository table containing Static SQL Queries, encompassing logic for generating insert scripts to be executed in a specified sequence.

2. C_L_SRC_ING_RTN: Contains PMDM-formatted Product data.

3. C_L_STG_ING: Temporary stage table used in the process execution.

For Internal Use Only - General and Administrative:

m_pm_land_ingestion_file

4. C_L_REPOS_ING_CONFIG: Repository configuration table containing information regarding tables and attribute names as per IDMP element numbers.

The mapping m_pm_sql_onj_dyn_rtn contains PRE_SQL logic to truncate stage tables and delete data from bridge tables.
